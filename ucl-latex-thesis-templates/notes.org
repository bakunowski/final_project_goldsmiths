* TODO Preamble
** TODO Abstract 
** TODO Acknowledgements
* TODO Introduction
** TODO talk about iZotope's neuron maybe? how i'm following their philosphy a lil bit (bit from rebecca's interview: https://juce.com/discover/stories/adc-spotlight-rebecca-fiebrink) 
* TODO Literature Review
** TODO Problem background
*** TODO add some studies for describing the problem either directly or by bits
*** TODO possibly talk about how these studies differ from what i've done 
** TODO Audio descriptors 
*** TODO describe ffts in more detail
*** TODO describe mfccs in more detail
*** TODO add studies to confirm their usefullness and describe why i started off with MFCCs 
*** TODO think about how to structure it->rythymicall vs timbral?
*** TODO add citations 
** TODO Granulation 
*** TODO lack of research into corpus based synthesis? 
*** TODO mention CataRT 
*** TODO is the content here appropriate for the literature review chapter? 
*** TODO add citations 
** TODO Machine Learning 
*** TODO add citations 
* TODO Methods
** TODO think about the structure and create appropriate sections 
*** TODO audio analysis
**** TODO more precise description of why frames are needed and why hopsize is needed. 
*** TODO ml
**** TODO for now the only thing i can explain is the multi layered perceptron i have implemented
***** TODO go in depth here 
***** TODO add the theory behind it 
***** TODO add some equations
***** TODO make it look professional and like i know what i'm talking about hahaha
**** TODO try to think about how to talk about different ones, especially mentioned in the ppr -> knn, MLP(done), LSTM (maybe rather in future work discussion)
**** TODO perhaps mention rebecca in the parameter walktrhough idea 
*** TODO the synth itself
**** TODO basic stuff about a granulator (cite some books) 
***** TODO use microsound as the reference, good diagrams etc. 
**** TODO how i have implemented it (maths and code examples)
**** TODO go through each parameter and explain what exactly it does to the grains
* TODO Results and analysis
** TODO a note on methodologies 
*** TODO explain how and what has been done briefly ( what could lead to some misconceptions -> shiffling data etc.)
** TODO think about and make notes about results 
*** comparing images of spectra?
*** euclidean distance between mfccs?
* TODO Discussion
** TODO summary of findings 
*** TODO found shit basically
*** TODO onset detection useless, not correlated directly with the grain size parameter
**** TODO show graphs
*** TODO MLPs useless on the temoral data that i have
** TODO evaluation 
*** TODO not sure, the same as above but in more detail?
** TODO future work 
*** TODO change ML algorithm to LSTMs
*** TODO add grain envelope to the granlator
*** TODO implement a better UI, difficult to know how to operate this
*** TODO extend to predict any uploaded file, as well as input longer/shorter than one second
* TODO Conclusion
** read the bloddy paragraph in the pdf and follow
