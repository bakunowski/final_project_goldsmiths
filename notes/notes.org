* Audio descriptors
** onsetRate example chain: fft -> onsetDetection -> onsets -> onsetRate
** maybe actually i could do analysis if state = playing, then stop, chang evalues, play again. clock that into being one second long ? 

* Spectral flux:

** https://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=187  
* To look at:
** onset times (onsetDetection -> onsetTimes)
*** this will be hopefully achieved with the spectral flux 
** Inharmonicity
** Dissonance
** Pitch
** ExtractorTempoTap
** PeakDetection -> nope, thresholding makes it unusable for my purpose basically
