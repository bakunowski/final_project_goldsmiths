* AUDIO EXTRACTORS (HIGH PRIORITY)
** DONE make a graph for a longer period of time to see how the threshold function behaves 
** DONE see if the onset detection works correctly by reading the articles again 
** TODO plot also the prunned and peaks array! this will be very useful to see if the code is working correctly
** TODO experiment with the flux threshold function and length of the buffer being analyzed 
** TODO experiment with the window size ! 
** TODO check exactly where the flux algorithm is calculated and how it correlates to the longer buffer which is analyzed now in printFluxValues 
** TODO make the flux extractor function periodic -> based on grain length -> basically like looping -> see if a connection can be made between the grain length and amount of peaks in the signal
** TODO try removing peaks that are too close together (~10ms) in the flux algorithm 
** TODO experiment with window overlapping 
** TODO add some sort of pitch extraction
** TODO explore more algorithms and see what sticks (not much time left for this)
* MORE SOFTWARE (HIGH PRIORITY)
** TODO make an audio player for feature extraction of a song/audio
** TODO start thinking about the parameter sweep for the dataset (analysis for each parameter setting)
** TODO see if a separate software for audio extraction can be done -> send buffer from both granulator and audio player and extract in one place 
* CLEANUP
** TODO put buttons and sliders into separate file 
* NON-PRIORITY
** TODO add a grain envelope
** TODO perhaps after automating the walkthrough -> do some sort of a visualisation fo parameters vs features -> to uncover any patterns -> just like with any other dataset -> see iris 
** TODO change granulator's randomize function to only randomize grain position and rename to "spread"
