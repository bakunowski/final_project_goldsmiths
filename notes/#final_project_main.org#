* MAIN GOALS
** DONE FINISH THE FLUX
** DONE TAKE MFCC FOR A SECOND OF SOUND 
** TODO AUTOMATE PARAMETER WALKTHROUGH -> set of parameters -> one second -> extract MFCCs -> write to a file mfcc results and parameters used
** TODO train on all results from the above jazz + test on a set of sounds (described at the bottom of this doc) 
** TODO add pitch control 
* AUDIO EXTRACTORS (HIGH PRIORITY)
** FLUX
*** TODO make the flux extractor function periodic -> based on grain length -> basically like looping -> see if a connection can be made between the grain length and amount of peaks in the signal
*** TODO experiment with window overlapping 
** PITCH
*** TODO add some sort of pitch extraction
** TODO explore more algorithms and see what sticks (not much time left for this)
* MORE SOFTWARE (HIGH PRIORITY)
** DONE start thinking about the parameter sweep for the dataset (analysis for each parameter setting)
** TODO make an audio player for feature extraction of a song/audio
** TODO see if a separate software for audio extraction can be done -> send buffer from both granulator and audio player and extract in one place 
* CLEANUP
** TODO put buttons and sliders into separate file 
* NON-PRIORITY
** TODO add a grain envelope
** TODO perhaps after automating the walkthrough -> do some sort of a visualisation fo parameters vs features -> to uncover any patterns -> just like with any other dataset -> see iris 
** TODO change granulator's randomize function to only randomize grain position and rename to "spread"
** TODO add a randoom button to compare results 
* NOTES 
** make a set of sounds (maybe 6) from the granulator, on one perticular sample - a sound matching task based on six sets of sounds -> each increasingly complex
** maybe program the synth using human voice ? 
* PARAMETER WALKTHROUGH
** take mfccs for minimum values of each dial for entire sample  
** increment one dial by a some amount -> go again until dial maxed out
** increment 3 dials by some amount (including filePos)
** repeat until all parameters where written
