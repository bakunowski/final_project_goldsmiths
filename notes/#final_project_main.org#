* MAIN GOALS
** TODO train on all results from the above jazz 
*** TODO train a MLP on this data 
*** TODO try and train a recurrent NN on this data 
*** TODO and try to train an LSTM
** TODO test on a set of sounds (described at the bottom of this doc)
** DONE figure out how to make the model predict in C++ 
** TODO a button to start getting input from mic for one second,  
*** DONE put all in a buffer, 
*** DONE do an MFCC and feed into the extracted model to get predictions 
*** TODO and set parameters based on them.
* AUDIO EXTRACTORS (HIGH PRIORITY)
** FLUX
*** TODO make the flux extractor function periodic -> based on grain length -> basically like looping -> see if a connection can be made between the grain length and amount of peaks in the signal
*** TODO experiment with window overlapping 
** PITCH
*** TODO add some sort of pitch extraction
** TODO explore more algorithms and see what sticks (not much time left for this)
* MORE SOFTWARE (HIGH PRIORITY)
** TODO make an audio player for feature extraction of a song/audio
** TODO see if a separate software for audio extraction can be done -> send buffer from both granulator and audio player and extract in one place 
* CLEANUP
** TODO put buttons and sliders into separate file 
* NON-PRIORITY
** TODO add a grain envelope
** TODO perhaps after automating the walkthrough -> do some sort of a visualisation of parameters vs features -> to uncover any patterns -> just like with any other dataset -> see iris 
** TODO change granulator's randomize function to only randomize grain position and rename to "spread"
** TODO add a random button to compare results 
* MACHINE LEARNING
* NOTES 
** make a set of sounds (maybe 6) from the granulator, on one perticular sample - a sound matching task based on six sets of sounds -> each increasingly complex
** maybe program the synth using human voice ?
